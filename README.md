This is my first project using React. This is a resource mining game with 3 resources : Stone, Food and Wood.

Gameplay

First you have to click on each resources to mine them one by one.
Once you have 10 elements of stone and wood you can craft a Tier 1 machine that allows you to mine 10 times faster.

The only goal is to have the most resources as possible as this is a learning project.

Setup

To try the game, you just have to do a "yarn start" in the project folder.
If some modules are missing, just do a "yarn add [missing_mudule]" and try again.
